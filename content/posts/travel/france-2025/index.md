We started in Geneva for a couple of days, and travelled to a small commune in France called Sallanches. It was in close proximity to the ski areas of Chamonix and Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, both of which we visited throughout the week. Our trip ended with a few days in Lyon before heading back to the States.
